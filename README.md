# ECE570-CHECKPOINT3

Code file name - final_neural_network.py contains final working code

To check the metric plots run - result_interpretation.py file

Code can be run in google collab, save the excel file at the same location so it can extract the data files.

Code uses cuda, so need to enable gpu for faster performance

Thank you
